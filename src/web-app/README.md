# Meetup Portal web site

## API

Here we have a simple api which is responsible for obtaining file path and file content from request body and then save content to corresponding file on file system. We will always expect to have static pre-rendered html inside file content and we will always append file name with '.html'. All files will be saved in web site root folder.

## Assets

Here we will store common static assets like jQuery, bootstrap, etc.
